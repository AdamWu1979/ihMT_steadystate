# Steady-state ihMT sequences using multi-band pulses

This site is currently under construction. This software can be used for simulating the steady-state of bSSFP and SPGR MRI sequences when employing multi-band pulses in tissues with [inhomogeneous MT effects](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mrm.25174) and builds on prior work using non-selective multi-band RF pulses for [controlling saturation of MT effects](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.27442).
